# daring Widget

A circular display widget that uses a 0-100 input.

a volume widget included uses amixer
amixer function taking from blingbling under GPL

I will hopefully add more.

## Usage

    cd ~/.config/awesome
    git clone git://github.com/DocOcassi/daring.git

### In you rc.lua

    -- first
    local daring = require("daring")

    -- then add the volume widget
    davolume = daring_volume()
    
    -- in layout widget
    right_layout:add(davolume)


## Customizations

look at the code, and hack.
